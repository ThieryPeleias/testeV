Build a modern and responsive portfolio website using Astro, with a bilingual layout (Portuguese and English). The landing page should have six full-width sections:

1. Hero section with a responsive full-screen video background and a bold headline text.
2. Services section showcasing the main services offered, especially BIM 4D planning with immersive Unreal Engine experiences. Include short descriptions and icons.
3. Featured Projects section, easy to update or extend with new projects. Use cards or tiles.
4. Clients Carousel with logos, easy to maintain and add new entries over time.
5. Another full-screen video background section, for visual engagement.
6. Call-to-action (CTA) inviting visitors to contact, with a button linking to a separate contact page.

Include:
- A clean and sticky header with logo and language switcher (Portuguese / English).
- A footer with basic information and links to other pages (Services, Projects, Contact).
- Fully responsive design (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- Structure each main section so it can link to its own dedicated page (e.g. Services, Projects, Contact).
- Use clean, modern HTML/CSS practices, and optionally Tailwind CSS for styling.

Include placeholder assets (video, images, icons) and make the structure modular, so it can be easily edited later.

Add comments in the code to indicate where to change text or add content in both languages.
